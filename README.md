Tarot

This page is for anyone who is looking for a quick way to lookup the definitions and meanings for tarot cards.
Here we will implement: Dynamic User Interface Interactions
1. Navigation Bar will be Major | Swords | Wands | Cups | Pentacles
2. For basic info there will be somewhere for them to read some basics
    - May want to include link to further reading and information
3. After clicking MAJOR :-> Dropdown menu of the 22 cards from the major arcana
4. After clicking Swords / any other minor arcana :-> Dropdown menu with each card from the minor arcana including the pages, knights, queens, and kings.
5. After selecting a card: An image of the card in waide-smith tarot is shown. (This is the basic default). Allow for older deck images and new deck images for the image sliding.
6. At the bottom of image, nav tabs are available. Horizontal scroll menu for you to choose.
7. If you click a tab, modal pop up with dark opacity. Text describing the card shows. This way you can still partially see the card and read about it at the same time.
