There could be chances that you shall meet your prospective partner. If you are in a toxic relationship, the Fool suggests freedom and better opportunities regarding self-love and self-healing. If you have pulled this card in your tarot reading, you should seek motivation in your life ahead.`,
spirituality: `The fool indicates that you are the beginning of a new spiritual journey, which will lead on to great things. You will be eager to try many new approaches. Allow yourself to do so. Others may not understand your journey, but you should do what is right for you.`,
cardDesc: `The fool depicts a young man standing on the edge of the cliff. He has a huge grin on his face as though he has no care in the world. He carries his knapsack on a long cane. He gazes upwards to the sky, oblivious of what unknown is before him. There is a small white dog (symbolizing loyalty and protection) that is barking at him (it can be interpreted as encouragement or as warning). There are mountains in the background and large body of wave indicating possible danger, difficulty. <br><br>
If you look back at the older cards, the fool card is actually a depiction of a court jester. Everyone has to speak carefully in court but the court jester is the only person who can speak freely but be pardoned because everything he said was in jest. This itself asks us to be honest with ourselves.`,

This card has an unfavorable representation of ambition. It is too much ambition without consideration of the people surrounding you. It makes you a gloating winner or a sad loser. This card asks us to set aside our ego and show consideration for others. Take some time to talk it out and gain clarity. Seek understanding.`,

The Five of swords can sometimes indicate that you are part of the problem. Self-victimization may also be the source of your issues. Be more conscious of your own actions.<br><br>

Divorce and separation is possible. You shouldn't have to fear your partner, and if you do, there is a serious and severe problem. This card indicates unexpected unpleasant shifts. Arguments, confrontations, tensions may break out. Stop and consider why are you fighting. Is it just because you want to "win"? Is it your ego being in control?`,
    spirituality: `In a spiritual context, Five of Swords indicates that challenges you have overcome have given you wisdom, strength and empathy to heal others. You may also find yourself pursuing a new spiritual path when it appears.`,

His enemies are walking away from him with their backs turned against him, looking somber. He gathers his spoils, the swords of his enemies. Even though the fight has ended, the sky above them remain turbulent and cloudy. Indicating that one may have won the battle but may have lost the war. This card strongly shows that one is involved in some conflict that breeds anger. <br><br>
    You may be alienated despite being the "Winner". It is possible that you may need to appreciate others' point of view and agree to disagree. It is okay to have difference of opinion. But it's not the best idea to rub the fact that you were right in someone's face. 
    <br><br> 
    If this conflict is recent, you have an opportunity to take action. If you take the hard stance, you will lose some friends. Think carefully if you can deal with the consequences of losing them.`,
